"""
Data structures for submissions events.

- Events have unique identifiers generated from their data (creation, agent,
  submission).
- Events provide methods to update a submission based on the event data.
- Events provide validation methods for event data.

Writing new events/commands
===========================

Events/commands are implemented as classes that inherit from :class:`.Event`.
It should:

- Be a dataclass (i.e. be decorated with :func:`dataclasses.dataclass`).
- Define (using :func:`dataclasses.field`) associated data.
- Implement a validation method with the signature
  ``validate(self, submission: Submission) -> None`` (see below).
- Implement a projection method with the signature
  ``project(self, submission: Submission) -> Submission:`` that mutates
  the passed :class:`.Submission` instance.
- Be fully documented. Be sure that the class docstring fully describes the
  meaning of the event/command, and that both public and private methods have
  at least a summary docstring.
- Have a corresponding :class:`unittest.TestCase` in
  :mod:`events.domain.tests.test_events`.

Adding validation to events
===========================

Each command/event class should implement an instance method
``validate(self, submission: Submission) -> None`` that raises
:class:`.InvalidEvent` exceptions if the data on the event instance is not
valid.

For clarity, it's a good practice to individuate validation steps as separate
private instance methods, and call them from the public ``validate`` method.
This makes it easier to identify which validation criteria are being applied,
in what order, and what those criteria mean.

See :class:`.SetPrimaryClassification` for an example.

We could consider standalone validation functions for validation checks that
are performed on several event types (instead of just private instance
methods).
