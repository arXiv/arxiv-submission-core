"""
Integration with the classic database to persist events and submission state.

As part of the classic renewal strategy, development of new submission
interfaces must maintain data interoperability with classic components. This
service module must therefore do three main things:

1. Store and provide access to event data generated during the submission
   process,
2. Keep the classic database tables up to date so that "downstream" components
   can continue to operate.
3. Patch NG submission data with state changes that occur in the classic
   system. Those changes will be made directly to submission tables and not
   involve event-generation. See :func:`get_submission` for details.

Since classic components work directly on submission tables, persisting events
and resulting submission state must occur in the same transaction. We must also
verify that we are not storing events that are stale with respect to the
current state of the submission. To achieve this, the caller should use the
:func:`.util.transaction` context manager, and (when committing new events)
call :func:`.get_submission` with ``for_update=True``. This will trigger a
shared lock on the submission row(s) involved until the transaction is
committed or rolled back.

ORM representations of the classic database tables involved in submission
are located in :mod:`.classic.models`. An additional model, :class:`.DBEvent`,
is defined in :mod:`.classic.event`.

See also :ref:`legacy-integration`.

    Store an event, and update submission state.

    This is where we map the NG event domain onto the classic database. The
    main differences are that:

    - In the event domain, a submission is a single stream of events, but
      in the classic system we create new rows in the submission database
      for things like replacements, adding DOIs, and withdrawing papers.
    - In the event domain, the only concept of the announced paper is the
      paper ID. In the classic submission database, we also have to worry about
      the row in the Document database.

    We assume that the submission states passed to this function have the

    the event and the before/after states refer to the original classic
